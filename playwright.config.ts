 *
 * They used to talk to a BroadcastChannel transport instead, because the game lived
 * in one of the tabs and there was no server to run. That made the suite fast and
 * deterministic and meant it never once exercised the path a player actually takes.
 * The room is a worker now, and workerd runs locally, so there is no longer a reason
 * to test a lookalike: what CI drives here is production, minus the domain name.
 *
 * The build must be made with `VITE_RELAY_URL` pointing at that worker — `npm run
 * build:e2e` — because the URL is baked into the bundle *and* into the page's
 * `connect-src`, and a preview built without it has no room to talk to.
