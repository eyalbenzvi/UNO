 * The block alphabet: ten numerals and the letters of the wordmark, drawn as

 *
 * No system font has the shape these want. The printed deck's digits are very
 * wide, very heavy, geometric, and cut off flat at every terminal — closer to
 * moulded plastic than to type — and a font at weight 900 extrudes into
 * something thin and generic. Drawn as polygons they also cost nothing to
 * extrude: `blockGeometry` turns any outline into a solid, so the numerals get the
 * same walls and internal edges as every other symbol.
 *
 * Everything is drawn on one body: 76 units tall, sitting on a baseline at
 * y = 76, with a stroke around 18 units thick. Widths differ per character, and
 * each is centred by the fit, so a 1 is not stretched to the width of an 8.

 * The bar under a 6 and a 9, for the corner index alone.

 * A 9 here is a 6 stood on its head — geometrically identical to one, not merely
 * similar — and a card prints its index at both ends with one of them turned
 * over. So without something to break the symmetry the bottom index of a 6 *is*
 * a 9, which in a fanned hand, where a corner is often all that shows, is a card
 * read as the wrong card. A printed deck solves it the same way.
 *
 * Only the index, though, and that is the whole reason this is a parameter rather
 * than part of the numeral. The bar sits below the baseline, so it grows the drawn
 * body from 76 units to 98 — and because every symbol is fitted to the same box,
 * a barred numeral comes out about a fifth smaller than an unbarred one. At the
 * size of a corner index that is invisible. In the middle of the card it would
 * put a visibly smaller 6 next to every 5, to solve an ambiguity the middle of
 * the card does not have: the large numeral is always upright.
 *
 * Thick, because the index is stroked heavily to survive being a few millimetres
 * across, and a thin bar is swallowed whole by its own outline.
