/**
 * Keeps the screen awake while a game is on the table.
 *
 * A phone that dims and locks is the most ordinary way a player "disconnects":
 * the tab is suspended, the peer connection dies with it, and nobody touched
 * anything. This does not fix a background tab — nothing in a web page can — but
 * it prevents the case where the game is *in front of the player* and the device
 * puts itself to sleep anyway.
 *
 * Every failure is swallowed. The lock is unsupported on several browsers, is
 * refused outside a secure context, and is revoked whenever the page is hidden;
 * none of that is worth a word to the player, so an absent lock simply means the
 * old behaviour.
