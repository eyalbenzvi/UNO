/**
 * The layer that tells the lie.
 *
 * Cards are cloned onto an overlay and flown between anchors while the real table
 * is **already correct**. That asymmetry is the entire safety argument: a clone
 * owns nothing, so a state update arriving mid-flight never has to be rolled back,
 * a rejected move needs no unwinding, and the worst case is a decoration that is
 * briefly out of date. Nothing here is awaited and nothing here can block an input.
 *
 * The clones are real DOM copies of cards that already exist — `cloneNode` of the
 * card on the discard pile, or of the pile's own back — rather than React elements.
 * Two reasons. A copy is pixel-identical for free, including the five extruded
 * symbol groups a card face is built from, which would otherwise all be rebuilt.
 * And it keeps decoration out of React entirely: no state, so no render cascade,
 * and nothing for the compiler's rules to object to.
 *
 * It must be a sibling of the table region, never a child: that region is a size
 * container, which makes it a containing block for absolutely positioned
 * descendants, and it also scrolls.
