 * Holds the "never declared!" button back for the head start a last card buys.
 *
 * The host is the authority — it refuses a catch made inside the window whatever
 * a client believes — but a button that appears and then answers "there is nobody
 * to catch" is a worse control than one that is not there yet. This is the same
 * rule, rendered.
 *
 * Timed from the moment *this* client first saw the seat come down to one card,
 * which is the room's moment plus however long the snapshot took to arrive. That
 * only ever makes the button appear later than the room would allow, never
 * earlier, so the two can disagree about the exact instant without a player ever
 * meeting a refusal. Measuring anything sharper would need the room's clock on
 * the wire, for the sliver of a social rule this window is.
 *
 * The window is held for the whole set of exposed seats rather than one each, and
 * the served flag is stored *with* the set it was measured for — which is what
 * makes a seat that leaves the set and comes back get a fresh window instead of
 * inheriting the old one. The cost is that a second seat coming down to a silent
 * last card restarts the window for both, so an existing button can blink off for
 * a moment. That needs two players to reach their last card inside the same
 * `LAST_CARD_GRACE_MS`, which is a fifth of a second, and it errs in the direction
 * the rule already leans — towards the player being called out.
