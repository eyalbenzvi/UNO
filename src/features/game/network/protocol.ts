 *
 * 3 — the plain number 2 left the deck; "last card" became a declaration anyone
 * can call out; Taki on Taki changes the colour of an open sequence; and a +3
 * Breaker with nothing to break is a legal, expensive card.
 *
 * 4 — resilience: acknowledged actions, seats that can be absent or gone, host
 * restarts and handover, table pauses.
 *
 * 5 — a King answers an open +2 run and cancels it, with a `drawRunCancelled`
 * event to say so. A rule, not a field: two peers on different sides of this
 * disagree about which cards are legal, which is exactly what the version gate
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * 6 — the room is the authority. There is no host peer to address, no host
 * generation to follow and no room to hand over, so `hostPeerId`, `generation`,
 * `handoffOffer` and `handoffAccepted` are gone; `hostClosed` becomes
 * `roomClosed`; `hostPlayerId` becomes `creatorPlayerId`, which names the seat
 * with the lobby buttons rather than the device running the game. The powers that
 * used to be method calls on a local object travel as `roomCommand`. Seat health
 * is what the runtime reports about a socket, so `'unstable'` — the state that
 * meant "we are inferring and unsure" — has nothing left to describe.
 *
 * 7 — a round has a *mode*. In `stairs` an empty hand is a step rather than a win,
 * so two peers on either side of this disagree about the single most important
 * thing at a table: whether the round is over. A stale tab would announce a winner
 * and then watch the game carry on without it, which is precisely what the gate
 * exists to prevent. The running score a room keeps across rounds rides along with
 * it.

 *
 * That problem belonged to the topology. The room is one deployed worker, every
