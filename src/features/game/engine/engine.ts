 * likely to be stuck. It also answers with its own rejection code, because the
 * caller is the room acting on a timer rather than a player taking a turn.
 *
 * The order below matters and each step re-reads the state the previous one left:
 *
 * 1. A Taki sequence the absent player owns is closed *properly*, through the
 *    real close transition, so the last card's effect is applied once and only
 *    once. Only a Plus leaves the turn with them afterwards; a number, Taki,
 *    Super Taki, Stop, Change Direction or +2 has already moved it on, and adding
 *    another advance here would skip an innocent player — two of them after a
 *    Stop. A colourless card cannot end a sequence, so those seven cases are
 *    exhaustive. A close is a move that was actually made, so nothing is charged
 *    for it; it is only what is left of the turn afterwards that is skipped.
 * 2. An outstanding +2 run is paid in full. It is an obligation somebody else
 *    created, and voiding it would either destroy cards or dump the run on the
 *    next seat, who did nothing to deserve it.
 * 3. Every other skip costs one card from the pile — the same card the same turn
 *    would have cost had they been there to take it. A free pass was the cheapest
 *    turn at the table: a hand that cannot grow cannot lose, so a seat that dropped
 *    out at the right moment came out ahead of one that played, and orbiting a
 *    disconnected player cost them nothing at all. Ending the turn by taking the
