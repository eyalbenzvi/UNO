/**
 * The scenarios that used to end a game, played through the real UI against the real
 * room.
 *
 * These used to be about the *host's* tab and everything built to survive its
 * disappearance: a resume card, a room-code reclaim, a handover to another player.
 * None of that exists any more, and what is left is much smaller to say and much
 * stronger to have: any player can reload, and their seat is where they left it.
 *
 * The reload tests give each player their own browser context, and that is not tidiness.
 * A resume reads the seat credential out of `localStorage`, which is per origin — so two
 * pages in one context are two players sharing one credential slot, and whoever joined
 * last owns it. Reloading the *first* page then rejoined as the *second* player's seat,
 * and the test passed on the strength of finding eight cards there. It only surfaced when
 * the room started telling a superseded socket why it had been closed, which turned the
 * loser's silent reconnect into the terminal answer it should always have been.
