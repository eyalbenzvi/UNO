/**
 * "Stairs" — טאקי מדרגות.
 *
 * The mode changes exactly one thing: what an empty hand means. In a classic round
 * it is the end; here it is a step, and the player comes straight back with a hand
 * one card smaller — eight, seven, six … down to one — until the eighth empty hand
 * wins the round.
 *
 * That "exactly one thing" is what most of this file is about. A step happens in the
 * middle of a turn that is still being resolved, so the interesting cases are all
 * about what the *rest* of the turn does afterwards: a Plus still buys another card
 * to play, a Stop still skips the next seat, an open Taki sequence is still open, and
 * a declaration made about the card that has just gone down does not follow its owner
 * into the new hand.
