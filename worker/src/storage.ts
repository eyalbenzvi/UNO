/**
 * The room's durable state, and the one interface it is reached through.
 *
 * Two records, each a single JSON blob validated on the way in *and* on the way
 * out: the room (`RoomRecord` — seats, phase, votes, the clocks the host used to
 * keep in memory) and the game (`GameState` — hands, deck order, the RNG's own
 * state). Nothing else survives a hibernation, and nothing else needs to.
 *
 * Why blobs rather than columns: the room record is at most six seats and is
 * always read and written whole — no query ever wants one seat — and it needs a
 * schema for validate-on-read regardless, which is a better description of the
 * shape than a table would be. The game state has to be a blob whatever we do,
 * because its *order* is the state: shuffle a draw pile into rows and you have
 * thrown the game away.
 *
 * `RoomStore` is deliberately three synchronous methods over strings. That is what
 * lets the whole room run in plain Node against a `Map` — see `worker/test/` — and
 * it is the same trick the old relay's `ClaimStore` used, extended from claims to
 * the entire game.
