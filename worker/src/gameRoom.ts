/**
 * The room, and the whole of the game's authority.
 *
 * This is what `src/features/game/network/hostSession.ts` used to be, moved off a
 * player's phone and into the Durable Object that every player is already connected
 * to. It holds the only complete `GameState`, validates every move through the pure
 * engine, deals every hand, drives the robots and owns every deadline. Every
 * player — including whoever opened the room — is an ordinary client of it.
 *
 * The platform is held at arm's length, exactly as the old `RoomCore` held it:
 * sockets, storage, the alarm queue and the clock are all injected, so the entire
 * room runs in plain Node with no workerd. `room.ts` is a thin adapter. That is
 * what makes the tests in `worker/test/` possible, and it is the reason this file
 * contains no `Date.now()`, no `setTimeout` and no reference to a `WebSocket`.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here, and used to be:
 *
 * - **Presence inference.** No ping nonces, no `ProbeTracker`, no counting of
 *   missed probes, no `'unstable'`. The runtime tells the room when a socket closes.
 *   An observation replaced roughly two hundred lines of guessing.
 * - **Any notion of the room moving.** No handover, no generations, no snapshot to
 *   ship to a successor, no "the host is restarting". The room is where it is.
 * - **A local player.** The old host was a player *and* the authority, so half its
 *   methods came in pairs — one for a remote seat, one for its own. There is one
 *   path now, and every seat takes it.

 * here: one wake a second is 86,400 a day, which is the *whole* daily request
 * allowance from a single table. The floor turns an unbounded bill into the largest
 * bill the plan permits. It buys a room that is still there to be debugged; it does

 * deadline is ever booked into the past — see `reschedule`, and the two tests that
