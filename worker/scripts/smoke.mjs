 * A real round, over real WebSockets, against the real worker under `wrangler dev`.
 *
 * Everything else in the repository tests the room with something injected: the unit
 * tests give it a `Map` for storage and a clock they control, and the app's tests
 * give it an in-memory pipe. This is the one place where none of that is true — a
 * spawned workerd, an actual Durable Object, actual SQLite, actual sockets — so it is
 * the only test that can catch the mistakes those seams hide: a value that does not
 * survive `JSON` round-tripping through storage, an attachment that does not come
 * back after a wake, a frame the runtime will not carry.
 *
 * It plays a two-player round to a winner, drops one player mid-round and brings
 * them back on their resume token, and exits non-zero on the first broken promise.
 * Run with `npm run smoke` from `worker/`.
